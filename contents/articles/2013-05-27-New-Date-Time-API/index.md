At some point during your day-to-day coding experience with Java you might have realised that the existing Java date and time classes are poor, mutable, and have unpredictable performance. There has been a long-standing desire for a better date and time API based on the [Joda-Time](http://joda-time.sourceforge.net/) project. The good news is that the new API that got delivered with [JDK8 milestone M6](http://openjdk.java.net/projects/jdk8/milestones#M6) has a more intuitive design allowing code to better express its intent. The classes are immutable which aligns with the multi-core direction of the industry.

The code for this new API originated on Sourceforge and then migrated to [GitHub](https://github.com/ThreeTen/threeten) and further got integrated into OpenJDK. Eventually, [JSR-310](http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=310) has now simply become a part of the greater JDK8 JSR.
