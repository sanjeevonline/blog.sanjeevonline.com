Here are a few quick pointers that have worked for me to improve code quality in agile teams and to deliver stories completely without leaving bugs behind.

* Improve how retrospectives are done so they can effectively detect and address these kinds of quality problems
* If there are quality differences in the code written by different team members, have the better programmers find ways to raise the quality of code written by others.
* Focus on defect prevention, not just detection. Tools that can help are:
	* code inspections
	* checklists
* Use pair-programming to improve knowledge sharing within the team. It seems expensive but mostly it is worth it.
* Begin regular use of static or dynamic code analysis tools.
* Implement continous integration tools to proactively detect and prevent code quality issues
